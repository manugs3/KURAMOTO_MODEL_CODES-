# KURAMOTO_MODEL_CODES-
Codes for simulation(fortran) and graphical representation(gnuplot ) of the kuramoto model's results. And 2 cool gifs showing total synchronization of a 2D kuramoto model with n.n interaction and oscillator syncronization in a unit circle with lorentzian natural frequency distribution:).
